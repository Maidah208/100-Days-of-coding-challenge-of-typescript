/*
Open Developer Tools: First, open your browser's developer tools. You can usually do this by right-clicking on a webpage and selecting "Inspect" or by pressing F12.

Navigate to the "Sources" Tab: In the developer tools window, look for a tab named "Sources" or "Debugger" (the name may vary slightly depending on the browser). Click on this tab.

Find Your JavaScript File: In the "Sources" tab, navigate to the JavaScript file that contains the code you want to debug. You may need to 
expand folders to find the correct file.

Set a Breakpoint: Once you've found your JavaScript file, click on the line number where you want to set a breakpoint. A blue marker will appear, indicating that a breakpoint has been set on that line.

Run Your Code: Now, run your JavaScript code as you normally would. You can trigger events, reload the page, or perform any action that executes the code containing your breakpoint.

Pause Execution: When your code reaches the line with the breakpoint, it will pause execution. You'll see the code highlighted in the developer tools window.

Inspect Variables: While execution is paused, you can inspect the values of variables at that point in the code. You can hover over variables to see their current values, or you can add them to the "Watch" panel for easier monitoring.

Step Through Code: You can step through your code one line at a time using the controls provided in the developer tools. This allows you to see how each line of code is executed and how it affects the state of your program.

Resume Execution: Once you've finished inspecting and debugging the code at the breakpoint, you can resume execution by clicking the "Play" button or pressing F8. Your code will continue running until it reaches another breakpoint or completes execution.

Using breakpoints in browser developer tools is a powerful way to diagnose and fix issues in your JavaScript code. It allows you to see exactly what's happening at each step of execution, making it easier to identify and resolve bugs.
